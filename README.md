This is a minimal fork of Chuckya (TheEssem/mastodon) used on [mastodo.neoliber.al](https://mastodo.neoliber.al). The upstream readmes are preserved below

Chuckya is a close-to-upstream soft fork of Mastodon Glitch Edition (more commonly known as glitch-soc) that aims to introduce more experimental features/fixes with the goal of making the overall experience more enjoyable. Although it's mainly developed for and used on the [wetdry.world](https://wetdry.world) instance, it can be deployed by any server admin as a drop-in, backwards-compatible replacement for Mastodon.

Here are some of the changes compared to glitch-soc:

- Emoji reactions (glitch-soc/mastodon#2462)
- Tenor GIF picker (originally from [koyu.space](https://github.com/koyuspace/mastodon))
- Mastodon Modern theme (licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0, [original repo](https://codeberg.org/Freeplay/Mastodon-Modern))
- Workaround for OpenGraph video embeds when using [Jortage](https://jortage.com)
- Multiple fixes for oEmbed/OpenGraph embeds
- Polls can be posted alongside media (glitch-soc/mastodon#2524)
- Polls can have only one option
- Restores status trend half-life to 2 hours
- Allows dashes in custom emote names
- Emojis can be put side-by-side
- Minor media attachment tweaks
- Custom favicon

Changes previously in Chuckya that made their way into vanilla Mastodon:

- Unicode emojis use [`jdecked/twemoji`](https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji) v15 graphics (mastodon/mastodon#28404)

Setup instructions are the same as [glitch-soc's](https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs); just replace the glitch-soc repo URL with `https://github.com/TheEssem/mastodon`.

Original glitch-soc readme is below.
